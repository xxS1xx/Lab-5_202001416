## Basic Knowledge about pylint output
| Sr.No. | Message Object | Expansion | Explanation |
|:------:|:--------------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| 1. | C | Convention | It is displayed when the program is not following the standard rules |
| 2. | R | Refactor | Is is displayed for bad code smell |
| 3. | W | Warning | It is displayed for python specific problems |
| 4. | E | Error | It is displayed when that particular line execution results some error |
| 5. | F | Fatal | It is displayed when pylint has no access to further process that line |

## My understanding of the output
1. C0304 : Missing Module Error: A module docstring is a string that appears at the beginning of a
Python module and provides information about the module's purpose, contents, and usage. Pylint
expects every module to have a docstring and raises an error if it's missing.

2. E1101 Class ‘Coupon’ has no ‘objects’ member: The E1101 error in Pylint is a warning message that
indicates an instance attribute has been accessed before it has been defined. This error typically
occurs when an instance attribute is accessed within a class or method, but it has not been defined
within the class or its parent classes.

3. W0611 Unused render imported from django.shortcuts: The W0611 error in Pylint is a warning
message that indicates an unused variable. This error is triggered when a variable is defined but not
used anywhere in the code

4. C0114 : Missing Module Error: A module docstring is a string that appears at the beginning of a
Python module and provides information about the module's purpose, contents, and usage. Pylint
expects every module to have a docstring and raises an error if it's missing.

5. C0116 : Missing function docstring: This error message indicates that Pylint has detected a missing
docstring in your function or method. To resolve this error, you should add a docstring to your
function or method.

6. C0303 : Trailing whitespace: This error message indicates that Pylint has detected one or more
lines of code that end with trailing whitespace. To resolve this error, you should remove the trailing
whitespace from the affected lines of code.

7. C0103: Argument name ‘id’ doesn’t conform to snake_case styling: This error shows that proper
variable naming conventions is not used. Here pylint suggests that we should use snake_case
convention for naming variables.

8. W0622 : Redefining built-in ‘id’: Used when a variable or function override a built-in. This means
that the ‘id’ variable is redefined again somewhere inside code.

9. C0303 : Trailing whitespace: This error message indicates that Pylint has detected one or more
lines of code that end with trailing whitespace. To resolve this error, you should remove the trailing
whitespace from the affected lines of code

10. R0903 : Too few public methods: The error basically says that classes aren't meant to just store data,
as you're basically treating the class as a dictionary.

11. E0307 : __str__ does not return str: If the __str__ method of a class does not return a string, it can
lead to errors when the method is called. For example, if you try to print an object that has a faulty
__str__ method, you may get unexpected output or an error message.
